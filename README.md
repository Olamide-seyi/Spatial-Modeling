# Spatial-Modeling
Carried out statistical spatial modelling to assess the prevalence of the co-occurrence of ARI, diarrhea and stunting observed among 69,579 children, data from the NDHS (2013, 2015 and 2018) using Bayesian shared component model in R-INLA. Spatial maps show that co-morbidity of the three diseases, was greater in the north-eastern and southern parts of the country.
